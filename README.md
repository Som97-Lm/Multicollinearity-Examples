# Multicollinearity Examples

This repository contains example notebooks demonstrating how to detect, visualize, and resolve **multicollinearity** in regression datasets.  
These examples build intuition by showing how correlated predictors behave in practice, how VIF changes, and how feature modifications improve model stability.
